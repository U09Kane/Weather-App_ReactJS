# Weather App 
---
A very simple application built using React.js and the OpenWeatherMap API. 

I followed this YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204C9yNeOYI) by __Hamza Mirza__.

After gaining a bit more experience with React I went back and changed the project structure as well as some of the logic to fit modern React conventions. 

I also updated the CSS to respond to different screen sizes however it still doesn't look right on mobile.
